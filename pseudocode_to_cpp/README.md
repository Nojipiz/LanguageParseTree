# :memo: Pseudocode to CPP
This project converts the input of the main function to C++ executable code, the output file is called "output.cpp" and will be generated in the resources folder.
```
    cargo run path/to/file
```
Here is an example of the pseudocode that can be transpiled into the compiler:
```
counter <- 2
for counter until 20 step 1
    counter <- counter + 1
end

anotherCounter <- 0
while counter less 10
    print "Hello World!"
end
```

And the output for this code will be:
```cpp


```
